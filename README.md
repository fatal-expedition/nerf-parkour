7 Days to Die Modlet: Remove boosted jump height for Parkour perk

## Features

- Remove extra jump height from Parkour skill
- Call out the adjustment made within the perk so players are aware before dumping points into its skills

## Purpose

If Parkour operated a little more like how it does in Dying Light, for example... this wouldn't be a problem. Instead, we just have "extreme jumping"...

It's my view that boosted jump height makes for a poor PVP experience, so this modlet removes it.
